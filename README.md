This is a part of project which I made for Microsoft Engage 2023.

This repository contains the information about the models running in background of my content filtering based movie recommender. It has jupyterlab codes for k-means clustering for grouping movies as per genre, and cosine similarity for finding out if a user has liked a particular movie then as per genre and emotions described which movie is closest to this one and should get recommended.

It also has the code for the content based filtering method which I have preferred because it does not has any issues with user's private information . Either oif the collaborative or hybrid filtering method use a particular user's past viewing history to recommend them movies, while we will recommend user a movie as per the ratings given to it by other users and his/her current genre mood.
